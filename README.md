# Project Name
Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

d)Model Building & training
e)Chose an appropriate data augmentation strategy to resolve underfitting/overfitting
f)Model Building & training on the augmented data
g)Class distribution
h)Handling class imbalances
i)Model Building & training on the rectified class imbalance data

## Technologies Used: 
Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib,
Augmentor,
Keras,
TensorFlow,
Python 3

## Conclusions
The issue of overfitting and underfitting was successfully addressed, leading to a well-trained model capable of making accurate predictions. Key strategies such as data augmentation, outlier handling, and class equalization significantly contributed to enhancing the model's performance in this scenario.
